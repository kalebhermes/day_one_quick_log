# day_one_quick_log
Quickly capture your smaller thoughts throughout the day, and have them logged into a **single**, timestamped journal entry, automatically, at the end of the day.

## Why?
After listening to the [Day One Podcast](), during their interveiw with Paul Mayne, he mentions that his original idea for Day One was like a personal, private Twitter. Somewhere he could put little chunks of text, that were just for him. That really appealed to me, but as someone that doesn't use Twitter much, I realized I wanted to start capturing the little things that happen through out the day, things that you might not remember when sitting down to journal that evening, or the next day. However, I like having a single entry per day, per journal, meaning using the Manu Bar Widget / Chrome Extension / iOS Force Press quick capture tools didn't appeal to me, as each of them creates a new, unique entry. 

### Concepting
When concepting, I wanted a tool that let me log from my Mac or iPhone. It needed to be quick, so I could get those fleating thoughts down before they were gone. I wanted one entry per day, with each days logs compiled into a line-break delenated body, pre-appened with timestamps from the original log time. That way you could look back at an entry, and get an idea of thoughts as they happened in a given day.
